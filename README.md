<p>💻A dynamic and fluid website project where you can track live currency and gold prices.</p>
<p>In this project, I aimed to improve myself in terms of API usage and certain design aspects. My website updates the data from the API every 5 seconds, ensuring that the information stays current. I also implemented a feature where the data is checked upon arrival; if the value is lower than the previous one, it turns red, and if it is higher, it turns green. Additionally, if there is an issue with the API and the data cannot be retrieved, the system notifies the user that the data could not be fetched. To enhance the appearance and usability of the website, I utilized various libraries while striving to maintain a clean and minimalist design, avoiding unnecessary complexity.🔮</p>
